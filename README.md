# demo-sso-mobile
An example mobile application in React Native that showcases the app-to-app interaction flows between the Smartwallet and another mobile app. In order for this demo app to function as intended, please ensure that you have the SmartWallet app on your phone and an identity created with Name and Email credentials filled out.

Install
----------------------------------------

To begin, we need to clone this repository and install all dependencies:

``` bash
  # clone the repository and navigate to the new folder
  git clone https://github.com/jolocom/demo-sso-mobile.git; cd ./demo-sso-mobile

  # install all dependencies
  yarn install
  # or
  npm install
```
```bash
  # for Android devices, install a debug/dev build on device
  react-native run-android
```
In another terminal window, run the development server:

```bash
  # for Android devices
  yarn android
```

Authentication
----------------------------------------

Tapping on the button to continue with Jolocom will ping an endpoint on the Jolocom Demo SSO which sends a CredentialRequest to your device.

This CredentialRequest will be consumed via deeplinking app to app communication between the Demo SSO Mobile application and the SmartWallet.

The corresponding CredentialReponse generated by the SmartWallet will be receivable and consumable by the Demo SSO Mobile application.
